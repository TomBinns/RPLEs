# RPLEs
MATLAB Data analysis scripts for investigating the occurence of RP-like events in EEG and simulated noise data.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1. For many of these scripts to work, the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) Toolbox for MATLAB must be installed [(github.com/bbci/bbci_public)](https://github.com/bbci/bbci_public).
2. Associated data for the scripts can be found at [osf.io/ymq2t/](https://osf.io/ymq2t/).

**INSTALLATION:**
- Install the repository within the 'bbci_public' folder of the BBCI toolbox.

**USAGE:**
- To run the analysis, use 'MasterAnalysis.m' and specify the location of the data (available at [osf.io/ymq2t/](https://osf.io/ymq2t/)).
- Scripts for generating classifier outputs and simulating noise can be found in the 'Generate' folder.
